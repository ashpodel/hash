title: Suitably Epic Dream

content: 
Phil Libin, the CEO of Evernote describes what he calls a 'suitable epic dream'. There has been a thread in my life around this. My fascination with self help books. Early blog posts. India is a country awash with mediocrity. Elitist of me to say that perhaps. I want to help people live up to their own potential. This could mean many things. This mean I could work in education (and that has been a pet peeve), it means I can work in career definition and hiring, it might mean I want to work on platforms.
