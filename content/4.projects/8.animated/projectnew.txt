*As proven by countless Tumblogs, apps like Cinemagram and Vine and more, we have to agree that the animated .gif is a new form of expression.*

I love that it inhabits the unusual space between a photograph and video, but one with its own unique personality, truly capturing a moment ‘stuck’ in time.

‘Animated’ was an attempt to get this new form of expression out of our phone and computer screens and out onto walls, while capturing people stuck in a fun moment. Installed at the annual 'Personal Statements' event at the Stanford Design Program.
