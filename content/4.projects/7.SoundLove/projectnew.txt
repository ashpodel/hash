*When did apps become the sole distribution method for music? What happened to mixtapes, cover art and all kinds of physical artefacts that were not just useful but also emotional?*

SoundLove is a concept that explores that idea. SoundLove is an app and device combo aimed at couples.

The app lets one person select any song from a music service like Spotify and send it to the other person's SoundLove device. The device lights up to show that someone has sent them music. They don't know what song it is, so the act of turning off the light to hear the song makes it a fun experience. 

This was product concept and Wizard of Oz prototype created for the class "Designing Media that Matters" at the Stanford d.school. I collaborated with another student on the user experience design. I built the app and device prototypes.

backstory:
##Oz all the way 

SoundLove was a fun concept to [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment). I used [Ratchet](http://maker.github.io/ratchet/) for the mobile interface and a tap light and an X-mini connected to a music player as the device prototype.
