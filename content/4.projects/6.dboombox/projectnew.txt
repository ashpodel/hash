My long standing dream to build my own MP3 player was finally realized with the d.Boombox. 

d.Boombox is a music player specially designed for conducting Design Thinking workshops. In such a workshop music is used to set the mood when the workshop audience is working (usually mellow or fast) and a gong is sounded to mark the end of an activity. Made using a Teensy Microcontroller and off the shelf components. 

Even though MP3 players have been consumed by smartphones, I think there is still a business case for a new MP3 player. This of course was a first attempt, my bucket list includes creating another.
