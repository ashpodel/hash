*My long standing dream to build my own MP3 player was realized with the d.Boombox.* 

d.Boombox is a music player specially designed for conducting Design Thinking workshops ([here's an example](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/)). In such a workshop, music is used to set the mood when the workshop audience is working (usually mellow or fast) and a gong is sounded to mark the end of an activity. d.Boombox incorporated these features by using two folders to store songs, controlled via a knob, and a dedicated button to sound the gong. This was created for 'Interactive Device Design' class at Stanford.

Even though MP3 players have been consumed by smartphones, I think there is a place for new kinds of music players, tailored to more specific uses. This was one such attempt. Here's a [video of the working player](http://youtu.be/qkGyUwxg3UM).
